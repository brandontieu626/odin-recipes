  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Xiao Long Bao, literally meaning “small basket buns”, is a type of steamed bun originating from Jiangsu province, China. Known as soup dumplings in English, they are a hybrid of Baozi (包子) and Jiaozi (饺子): having the shape of Baozi but using non-leavened wrappers like Jiaozi.

    What makes Xiao Long Bao stand out is its super delicate, thin wrapper and the delicious “soup” inside.
    
    Making Xiao Long Bao isn’t an easy task. But it isn’t impossible to produce restaurant standard ones at home. Please read my tips & tricks if you are up for the challenge.

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <h3>For the aspic (soup)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 medium-sized whole chicken</li>
    <li>3 stalks scallions</li>
    <li>6 slices ginger</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>For the wrappers</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>180 g all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>60 g hot water</li>
    <li>35 g tap water</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>For the filling</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>450 g minced pork</li>
    <li>3 stalks scallions</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon minced ginger</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon light soy sauce</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon Shaoxing rice wine</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon ground white pepper</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon sugar</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven at 390°F/200°C/Gas 6 (Fan-assisted 360°F/180°C)</li>
    <li>Place chicken in an oven-proof pot/pan/baking tray. Put scallions and ginger inside the chicken. Cover TIGHTLY with a lid/tin foil.</li>
    <li>Cook in the oven for 1 hour. Then leave to cool (covered).</li>
    <li>Keep the chicken for other dishes. Pour the liquid into a container. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours until it turns into a piece of jelly-like aspic (about 250g).</li>
    <li>In a mixing bowl, add hot water to the flour. Mix with chopsticks/spatula. Then add tap water.
Combine and knead into a dough. Leave to rest (covered) for 10 minutes then knead again until very smooth.
Cover and rest for a further 30-60 minutes until it becomes soft.</li>
<li>Mix minced pork with all the seasoning until well combined.
  Use a spoon to remove the layer of chicken fat on top of the aspic. Then use a fork to break it into tiny pieces. Add to the pork then mix well.
  Keep refrigerated for at least 30 mins. Don’t take out until you are ready to assemble the dumplings.</li>
  <li>Roll the dough into a rope. Divide into 20 pieces. Then press into discs with the palm of your hand. Cover at all times when not using (with cling film/in a plastic bag/with an upside-down bowl, etc.).
    With a rolling pin, use the “roll and turn” technique to flatten it into a very thin disc, about 12cm/4.7inch in diameter (Please refer to my tutorial video below). Dust the surface with flour if it sticks (see note 4).</li>
    <li>Line the steamer basket with steamer parchment paper, or cut regular parchment paper into squares (see note 5 if you are using a metal steamer).
      Place dumplings in (leave at least 3cm/1inch space between them).
      Bring water to a full boil in a wok/pot. Then put the steamer basket on top. Turn the heat to medium-low. Steam for 8 mins (if cooking over 10 dumplings at a time, increase to 10 mins).</li>
  </ol>
